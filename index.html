							<p class="justified">Ab Initio investigation of aqualead (II) complexes as possible corrosion products in Super Critical Water
								 Cooled Reactor (SCWR)
								 One of the issues affecting SCWR development is the possibility of corrosion of construction material.
								 The long term sustainability of SCWR largely depends on the ability to predict and control its water
								 chemistry. Formation of corrosion products such as metal-ligand complexes is poorly understood both
								 experimentally and computationally. Experimental research under extreme temperatures and pressures is
								 difficult; computational method becomes a key research tool. A series of ab initio calculations of lead (II)
								 complexes were performed.</p>
							 <p class="justified">SCWR utilizes supercritical water as a working fluid and operates at 650 °C and 25 MPa. Lead (Pb2+) is
								 an impurity within the construction material of SCWR. Traces amount of lead are found to be major cause
								 of the embrittlement. Traces of Pb2+ tend to dissolve from the construction material and form neutral
								 complexes with surrounding anions (OH-, Cl-) and water and/or ammonia, resulting in corrosion. </p>
							 <p class="justified">The objective of this research was to perform a comprehensive ab initio calculations of lead (II) complexes
								 including 4 different ligands: water, ammonia, hydroxide and chloride. Results include optimized
								 geometries, vibrational frequencies and energetics of lead (II) complexes. Ultimately, results will contribute
								 to development of an appropriate chemistry water control of SCWR.
							</p>
							 <p class="justified">Ab initio calculations were performed utilizing Gaussian03. The molecular geometries were fully optimized
								 sequentially at HF (Hartree-Fock), MP2 (second-order Møller-Plesset perturbation theory) and B3LYP
								 (Hybrid Density Functional Theory). Small atoms were studied using 6-31G*, 6-31+G* and 6-311+G* basis
								 sets, while Pb was investigated using effective core potentials (CEP-121G, LANL2DZ and SDD).
									The best candidates for corrosion products were identified: [Pb(H2O)8]2+; Pb(OH)2 and PbCl2 and their
								 hydration products.

								<p class="justified">Chemical Adviser for agricultural pharmacudical company Pinus and biodiesel company BioGoriva,
								 Slovenia. Designing labels with instructions for use for fito- pharmacudicals in accordance with DPD (1999/45/EC)/
								 DSD (67/548/EEC) directives, as well as CLP/GHS (2008/112/EC ).
								 I was responsible for writing labels with instructions for following companies: Pinus Slovenia, Serbia Pinus

									 Republic of Slovenia.

										“Protein Folding/Unfolding of Poly-(Glu)20 utilizing Nd:YAG laser equipped Photoacoustic Calorimetry”
										 and
										“Transient Optical and Potothermal Studies of CO binding to CT-cytochrome C at high pH”</p>
									 <p class="justified">Proteins have to be properly folded to their native conformation in order to obtain their biologically
									 active form which allows them to perform specific functions within the body. Protein misfoldng has been
									 implicated with a large number of devastating neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD),
									 Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (AS), cystic fibrosis and some forms of cancer. </p>
									 <p class="justified">Complete understanding of mechanisms through which proteins fold to their native structure opens the doors
									 towards uncovering therapeutics that will help patients suffering from these diseases and will ultimately
									 prevent development of neurodegenerative diseases. In order to map the mechanism through which proteins
									 fold to their native conformation, photoacoustic calorimetry (PAC) coupled with fast phototriggering
									 techniques (pH jump in case of Poly-(Glu)20 and CO photodissocitaion in case of CO-cytochrome c) was
									 utilized to obtain time-resolved thermodynamics on fast time scale (~50ns- ~10µs) for Poly-(Glu)20 and
									 CO bound native cytochrome c (CO Cyt c). Fast thermodynamics that were probed with PAC include
									 magnitudes and life times of enthalpy (#H) and molar volume (#V) changes associated with coil-to-helix
									 transition in case of Poly-(Glu)20 and unfolding-to-folding transition for CO-cytochrome c. Thus allowing
									 for probing dynamics of folding and unfolding of small peptides on the time scale from ~50ns to ~10µs
									 and identifying thermodynamic parameters that are missing pieces of the protein folding puzzle otherwise
									 unattainable with the traditional calorimetric techniques due to their lifetime limitations.</p>
									 <p class="justified">The study was focused on probing folding/unfolding dynamics of small proteins thus avoiding complexity
 										and heterogeneity associated with larger complexes.</p>
